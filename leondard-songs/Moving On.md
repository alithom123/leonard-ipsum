"Moving On"

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who broke the heart and made it new?
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

I loved your moods I love the way
They threaten every single day
Your beauty ruled me though I knew
Twas more hormonal than the view

Now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Queen of lilac, queen of blue
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who held me dyin' pulled me through
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?
