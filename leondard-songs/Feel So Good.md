"Feels So Good"

Feels so good, not to love you like I did
Feels so good, not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

Feels so good to wake up in the morning by myself
Cup of coffee in the kitchen, fire up a little danger to my health
Ah, they're selling freedom everywhere, it's flying off the shelf
Yeah, they're selling freedom everywhere but love, that's something else

Ah you drift into my dreams as if you had the right
And you show me how you broke me doing all the little things I really like
But I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight
Yeah, I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight

Well I don't know about tomorrow but I know what's coming next
I've used up all my questions; I have no answers left
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget

Feels so good not to wonder who you'll get
Who you love, who you touch and who you kiss
Oh baby, who'd ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this
Would you ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this

Feels so good not to love you like I did
Feels so good not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
